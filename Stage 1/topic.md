## Stage 1/4: Beginning

#### Description
Let's think about what a lan calculator should be able to do. In general, it takes
several parameters like a loan principal and interest, calculates the values the 
user wants to know (for example, monthly payment or overpayment), and 
outputs them to the user.

Not familiar with these concepts? Don't worry, we will explain them to you in
simple terms. The principal is the original amount of money you borrow. The 
interest is a charge for borrowing that money, usually calculated as a percentage
of the principal amount.

##### Objectives
Let's start by imitating this behavior. There are some prepared variables in the 
source ode: these are text messages that our loan calculator can output. In this
stage, all you need to do is output them in the right order.

#### Example
Output:

    Loan principal: 1000
    Month 1: repaid 250
    Month 2: repaid 250
    Month 3: repaid 500
    The loan has been repaid!
